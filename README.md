This is a simple python script that gets the current weather for NYC from "wttr.in/newyork." auth.py is a separate file that contains the TWitter API keys for your particular developer application. Make sure to create the variables with the same exact names. Also make sure to store this file on the same folder as tweet_the_weather.py and to have the overall folder on your home directory (Linix of Mac). This script is supposed to run on a cronjob on a server. I have mine running on a Raspberry Pi set to tweet the weather every 30 minutes.
